## About this project

The objective of this application is to be able to view books by simulating a bookstore. With access to the essential characteristics of any book and the price of these.
To access the CRUD you must register a user through the REGISTER option in the nav and then log in through the LOG IN option located there.
With this you will be able to visualize the ADD BOOK option located in the main page and the EDIT BOOK - DELETE BOOK options located in the details page of each book.
Once this is done you will be able to log out in the LOG OUT option also located in the nav.
